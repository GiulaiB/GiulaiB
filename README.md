<h1>👋 Hey, I'm Giulia </h1>

I'm a physics student working at the intersection of History of Physics and Physics Education.

<h3>🧰 My toolkit </h3>

- R
- C++
- A small but growing interest in Python

<h3> ☕ Fun fact</h3>

I love aesthetically pleasing plots… but I can spend hours deciding on the right colour palette.
