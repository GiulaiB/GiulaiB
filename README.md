<h1>👋 Hey, I'm Giulia </h1>

I'm a physics student working at the intersection of history of physics and physics education.

<h3>🌱 What I do </h3>

I'm on a learning journey in data analysis for habitat bioregionalisation. Most of my time right now goes into R: cleaning data, building workflows, keeping plots under control, and trying to maintain a clean repo structure.

<h3>🧰 My toolkit </h3>

- R and QGIS
- C++
- A small but growing interest in Python

<h3> ☕ Fun fact</h3>

I love aesthetically pleasing plots… but I can spend hours deciding on the right colour palette.
